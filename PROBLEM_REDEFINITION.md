# 🎯 Problem Redefinition: Scholarship Discovery in Kenya

## Original Problem Statement
> "Scholarships are scattered across websites, county offices, and social media. Parents don't know if their child qualifies."

## Critical Problem Analysis

### 1. The Information Problem

#### What We Think the Problem Is:
- Information is hard to find
- No centralized database

#### What the Problem Actually Is:
1. **Information Exists But Is Inaccessible**
   - County offices have lists but they're physical documents
   - NGOs post on Facebook but posts get buried
   - Government websites exist but are poorly organized
   - **Root Cause**: No aggregation layer

2. **Information Quality Is Unreliable**
   - Deadlines change but old info remains online
   - Scams masquerade as real scholarships
   - Requirements are unclear or contradictory
   - **Root Cause**: No verification mechanism

3. **Information Is Not Actionable**
   - Students find scholarships but don't know how to apply
   - Requirements are listed but eligibility is unclear
   - Deadlines are given but no reminders
   - **Root Cause**: No guidance system

### 2. The Trust Problem

#### Hidden Challenge:
Kenyan students and parents are **rightfully skeptical** of online platforms because:
- Scams are common (fake scholarships asking for money)
- Government services are often unreliable online
- Data privacy concerns (will my info be sold?)
- **Impact**: Even if we build it, they won't use it without trust

#### Trust Requirements:
1. **Verification Badges**: Show scholarship is verified
2. **Transparency**: Show data sources, last updated
3. **Privacy**: Clear privacy policy, data protection
4. **Community**: User reviews, success stories
5. **Official Partnerships**: Work with real organizations

### 3. The Eligibility Problem

#### Surface Problem:
"Students don't know if they qualify"

#### Deeper Problems:
1. **Complex Overlapping Criteria**
   - County-based + income-based + academic-based
   - Some require ALL, some require ANY
   - **Solution**: Clear eligibility breakdown

2. **Missing Information**
   - Students don't know their exact income level
   - Don't know if they count as "needy"
   - **Solution**: Guidance questions, examples

3. **Changing Eligibility**
   - Scholarships change requirements mid-cycle
   - Students think they qualify but don't
   - **Solution**: Real-time eligibility checking

### 4. The Application Problem

#### What Happens After Matching:
1. **Application Process Is Unclear**
   - "Apply online" but link is broken
   - "Submit to county office" but which office?
   - **Solution**: Step-by-step guides, verified links

2. **Documentation Is Confusing**
   - "Submit birth certificate" - original or copy?
   - "Proof of income" - what format?
   - **Solution**: Document templates, examples

3. **No Follow-Up**
   - Students apply but never hear back
   - Don't know if application was received
   - **Solution**: Application tracking, reminders

### 5. The Connectivity Problem

#### Real-World Constraint:
- Many students access internet via mobile data (expensive)
- Connectivity is unreliable in rural areas
- **Impact**: Platform must work offline, be data-efficient
